# Advent of Code 2022

These are my solutions to Advent of Code 2022, done in `Ruby`.

## Notes

Each day, I'll leave short notes about that day's challenge. I might blog about some days more thoroughly, in which case I'll link to the post

Last year, I lasted 8 days; the year before, 5-6. The challenge came from the problem difficulty, not from issues learning Ruby. This year, the goal is to complete all the challenges.
